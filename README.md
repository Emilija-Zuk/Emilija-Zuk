# 👋 Hi, I'm Emilija!

Welcome to my GitHub profile! Here you'll find projects focused on cloud, web development, and data visualization. My main interests are building interactive web apps, serverless backends, and automating infrastructure with modern tools.

## 🌬️ Featured Project: WindAI

**WindAI** is a web application for visualizing wind data and testing Python Lambda backends via AWS API Gateway. It combines a modern frontend (React, Chart.js) with a serverless backend (AWS Lambda, API Gateway), all deployed as a static site on AWS S3 and managed with Terraform.

### 🚀 What I Learned

- Building interactive data visualizations with React and Chart.js
- Creating serverless APIs using AWS Lambda and API Gateway
- Automating cloud infrastructure with Terraform
- Deploying static websites on AWS S3
- Integrating frontend and backend securely in the cloud

### 🛠️ Technologies I Use

- **Frontend:** React, JavaScript, Chart.js, HTML, CSS
- **Backend:** Python, AWS Lambda, API Gateway
- **Cloud & DevOps:** AWS, Terraform
